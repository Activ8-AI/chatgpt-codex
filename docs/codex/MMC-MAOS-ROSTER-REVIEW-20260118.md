## Purpose (Why This Exists)

This entry locks and activates the production templates required to run Roster Review v0.1 execution:
- Notion meeting notes template
- Teamwork task template
- Notion → Teamwork operating pattern
- Binding-level enforcement (L1–L7) with evidence sinks
- Dual-agent backup enforcement for L6+

---

## Scope & Applicability

Applies to MAOS (root), DMAOS, and LMAOS and governs:
- Agent roster reviews
- Binding level assignments and mutations
- Agent promotions (Draft → Active)
- Evidence capture and preservation

---

## Governance Pattern (Locked)

Notion = Source of Truth  
Teamwork = Execution + Evidence  
GitHub = Change Control  
Custodian Hub / Preservation Vault = Record of Authority

This hierarchy is non-negotiable.

---

## Binding & Authority Doctrine (Reaffirmed)

- L1–L3: Observational → Sandbox
- L4: Guarded autonomy (reversible)
- L5: Cross-system orchestration (no Charter bypass)
- L6: Critical Path Root Orchestrator (Dual-Agent Backup required: Prime + Claude)
- L7: Root of Trust / Charter Guardian (reserved)

Decision Authority Language (Locked):
PrimeAgent (L6) with ClaudeAgent Dual-Backup concurrence

---

## MCP Clarification (Charter-Critical)

MCP is infrastructure, not a client feature.
- MCP may instantiate Notion templates and create Teamwork tasks internally
- MCP operates below UI, decks, and client deliverables
- No client exposure without explicit Charter gate

---

## Required Activation Order (Canonical)

1. Create Notion template (“Template – Roster Review”)
2. Create Teamwork task template (“Roster Review – Agents & Binding”)
3. Tag MAOS action ACTIVE: A-MAOS-ROSTER-REVIEW-v0_1
4. Schedule first Roster Review (75 minutes, CT)
5. Execute meeting → produce Agent Roster v0.2
6. Sync AGENTS.md via PR (dual approval)
7. Archive artifacts to Preservation Vault

## Audit & Preservation

- Do not delete superseded entries; supersede explicitly
- Any structural change requires a new Codex entry with a supersession clause
